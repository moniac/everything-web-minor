# Vanilla JS vs Libraries & Frameworks
### Pro's and Cons

To talk about the benefits and cons of using a framework or library instead of pure vanilla JS, we need to define what a framework and a library is.

## Frameworks

A framework is an usually opinionated source of code that defines a way for you to use it. It is more often used for large projects starting at the beginning.

## Libraries

A library is a resource where you can use small pieces of code to help you in your project. The code can be used as you wish and is up to you to be manipulated or not.

## The advantage of using a Framework

Frameworks tend to pop up every other month. They exist to help solve a problem, such as making the use of ease much better.

* Express.js, a popular Node.js framework exists to make setting up routes and such much easier, making you write less code.
* React is a framework developed by Facebook, it primarily benefits the developers to work in a very clear and easy to maintain and reuse way.

## The cons

* A framework dictates the way you have to use it, if you don't use it as stated, it will more than likely not work.
* Frameworks have you at the mercy of it's maintainers, if they suddenly make significant changes, you have to learn everything.
* There is no guarantee that a framework will be updated

## The advantage of using a Library

Libraries have been around forever. They usually come from developers getting frustrated with current solutions, which makes them very popular.

* A library can be used entirely or just in small chunks, it's all up to you.
* You can manipulate the code in any way you wish
* There are a lot of libraries, so there is almost always a good amount of choice

## The cons

* Using a library can make you a lazy developer, instead of figuring out the problem you just go for the easy route
